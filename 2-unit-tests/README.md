# Unit Testing

Unit Testing is the art of writing maintenable source code. And you do so by writing tests that guarantee you are doing the right thing. 

> Unit Testable code is Clean Code.

## Why you should write Unit Tests

We are in continuous search of faster bugs-free software delivery.
The pressure on deadlines may induce you to think you do not have time to write more code to test your actual code.

> Code without unit tests is Legacy Code.
